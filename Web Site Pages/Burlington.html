<p><h3><strong>What the heck happened in Burlington?</strong></h3>

<p>Burlington's 2009 Mayoral Election is an instructive case for how Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is prone to producing non-representative outcomes in races with three or more strong candidates. Because our current voting system works when there are only two strong candidates, IRV's failure modes, when even just one more viable candidate is present, cast doubt on its viability as a long-term replacement for plurality voting.

<p><strong>The election summary</strong>

<p>Three strong candidates, A, B and C, faced off after the first elimination round. <a href="http://rangevoting.org/BurlOfficialTallies.html">8,980 ballots were cast</a> in total, 151 of which were exhausted after the first round. The full preference table* on the right shows that a plurality of the voters (4,067 vs 3,477) preferred A to B, and a majority (4,597 vs. 3,668) preferred A to C. Because A was preferred head-to-head over both B and C, A is the "beats-all candidate," also known as the <strong>Condorcet Winner</strong>.

<p>Despite the electorate's preference for A over both B and C, the instant runoff counting algorithm eliminated A before either B or C, and elected B in the final round without a majority (4,313 of 8,980) of the votes.

<p><strong>Why did this happen?<strong>
<p>IRV's counting algorithm only counts the second and subsequent preferences of <em>some of the voters</em>, namely those whose prior higher preference choices have already been eliminated. This means that the subsequent preferences of the voters who chose B or C first, whose ballots are highlighted in the orange rows above, <strong>were totally ignored by IRV</strong>. From the data above, it's clear that <em>the set of voters who placed B or C first preferred A second by strong super majorities over the alternative</em>. This was particularly bad for those who placed C in first position who had A as a second choice by more than a 3:1 ratio (1,513 to 495).

<p><strong>IRV maintains the spoiler effect</strong>
<p>For the voters who picked C as a first choice, this is a crystal clear example of IRV's spoiler effect at work. IRV advocates make the <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/rcv#rcvbenefits">demonstrably fallacious claims</a> that with IRV, "you can honestly rank candidates in order of choice without having to worry about how others will vote and who is more or less likely to win" and that IRV "allows more than two candidates to compete without fear of splitting the vote." Burlington voters who preferred C most were told they could honestly express their preferences on the ballot. As a result, they marked their preferences honestly and 3/4 of them got their worst possible outcome.

<p>Had even a quarter of those voters strategically placed A <em>above</em> C, they would have gotten an improvement - their 2nd choice would have won instead of their 3rd. Sincerely ranking their favorite candidate in 1st place hurt them.

<p><strong>The Fallout</strong>
<p>Burlington voted to repeal IRV the next year.

<p><strong>IRV advocate reconsiders</strong>
<p><a href="https://integralpsychosis.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/burlingtons-2009-mayoral-election-did-irv-fail-the-voters/">This analysis of the Burlington election</a> from an IRV advocate is telling (emphasis supplied): "In the past I have extolled IRV as being the best alternative because it generally is capable of creating paradoxes or violating the Fairness Criterion a reasonably low percent of the time. In my opinion, there may still be some truth to this, and it is entirely true that IRV out-performs plurality voting. However, what seems to be even more true is that <strong>there are other methods for voting which greatly out perform IRV</strong>, and at the very least a modified form of IRV is necessary to over-come its most glaring flaws."

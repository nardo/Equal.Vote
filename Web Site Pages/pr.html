<p>Proportional Score Runoff Voting, (SRV-PR) is a voting method that can elect multiple candidates in elections where more than one seat is available. Mark Frohnmayer, Seth Woolley, and Sara Wolf's late night musings -- based almost entirely on <a href="http://rangevoting.org/RRV.html">re-weighted range voting</a>.

<p>SRV-PR, like normal Score Runoff Voting, uses a score ballot, where the voter can assign a score to each candidate. We use 0-9 in this example.

<ul>
<li>Voters fill out their ballots as usual, giving the highest score to their favorite(s) and so on. The scores are totaled and the two candidates with the highest score advance to an instant runoff. Whichever you scored higher gets your full vote in the runoff. Just like in SRV. The first winner has been elected!<br><br></li>

<li>To find the next winner, the remaining candidates scores are counted again with one change. If you gave a non-zero score to the candidate that won a round, your ballot's influence is reduced in proportion to how much you "won." <strong>In every round,</strong> your ballot influence is 1 / (1 + sum/max), where sum is the total of the scores you've given to winning candidates. So if you gave 9/9 points to the winner of the first seat, your subsequent ballot influence would be 1/2 (1 / (1 + 9/9)). meaning that in the second round if you gave your next favorite 8/9 then it would be counted as a 4 from the influence multiplier.<br><br></li>

<li>As in the first round, the the candidates with the highest weighted scores advance to a runoff. Whichever you scored higher gets your full vote, multiplied by your ballot influence, in the runoff.<br><br></li>

<li>This process continues until enough candidate are elected to fill all the available seats.</li></ul>

<p>Weakening the ballots of voters who have already won allows minority voters to elect a winner as well if they have sizable proportion of the voting block. Minority groups will be better represented by the group of elected politicians. The runoff ensures that those minority candidates sill have wide support and works to prevent divisive extremist candidates from getting elected. This creates a legislative body that better represents all the voters as opposed to group that only represents the majority.

<p>Advantages over other forms of Proportional Representation:

<ul><li>The nature of the scored ballot and the election process encourages candidates to reach out to all voters, not just their core and it also keeps them accountable to all voters if the want to seek re-election.<br><br></li>

<li>SRV-PR is non-partisan. You don't just vote the party line, you actually choose which individual candidates you like and evaluate them based on whatever criteria is most important to you.<br><br></li>

<li>Conventional Proportional Representation has been linked to helping extremist factions come to power in the past, from the Nazis in Germany to the Fascists in Italy. The runoff stage helps eliminate small but passionate minorities that antagonize the rest of the voters while still giving other minorities a voice.<br><br></li>

<li>SRV-PR is less likely to elect polarized groups of candidates that can't agree on anything and can't get anything done. This is because of the incentive given by scored ballots to maintain approval from as wide a group of voters as possible.</li></ul>

<p>Disadvantages of SRV-PR:

<ul>
<li>Votes must be sent to a central location before they can be counted. This is true of all existing Proportional Representation systems.<br><br></li>

<li>Hasn't been tested in a real world election.<br><br></li>

<li>Elected officials aren't tied to specific districts. This can decrease accountability to local areas. This is true of all existing Proportional Representation systems.<br><br></li>

<li>SRV-PR is fairly complicated, though less so than other forms of PR with the exception of Re-weighted Range Voting.</li></ul>



Score Runoff Voting - Proportional Representation - SRV-PR â€“ a Proportional Representation voting method that feels like SRV (Mark Frohnmayer, Seth Woolley, Sara Wolf's late night musings -- based almost entirely on re-weighted range voting).

SRV-PR, like SRV, uses a score ballot, where the voter can assign a score to each candidate from zero to the maximum score (max).

Each ballot (voter) starts off with full (1.0) "influence" just like in normal SRV.

The scores on the ballots, multiplied by the ballot's influence are summed for each candidate, thus obtaining that candidate's total score.

The two highest scoring candidates advance to an instant runoff. In the runoff, the voter's current influence goes to the candidate he or she scored higher. Whoever wins the runoff is considered a winner and removed from contention.

After the vote, each ballot is given a new influence level, reduced in proportion to how much that ballot has "won" so far: new_influence = 1/(1 + sum/max) where sum is the sum of scores that ballot gives to the winners-so-far. For example, after the first round, any ballot giving the winner of the first seat the maximum score would have an influence of 1/2.

<p><strong>So where'd this whole campaign come from, anyway?</p>

<p>Score Runoff Voting is the accidental brain child of Rob Richie, Executive Director of <a href="http://fairvote.org">FairVote</a>, Clay Shentrup, Co-Founder of the <a href="https://www.electionscience.org/">Center for Election Science</a>, and Mark Frohnmayer, life-long political sciontist and founder of Equal.Vote. Rob's suggestion at the 2014 <a href="http://www.equal.vote/conference_one_pager">Equal Vote Conference</a> of an overseas absentee ballot that expressed both candidate approval for the equal top two and preference voting for the runoff sparked the realization that a score ballot provided both sets of data, and SRV was born.

<p>Equal.Vote itself is the evolution of the <a href="initiative_petition_38_version_1">Unified Primary campaign</a>, an effort to reform Oregon's partisan primary election system to use the <a href="srvvstoptwo">Equal Top Two</a>. Based on the <a href="phase_two_complete">experience from that election cycle</a> and the full-spectrum feedback from Oregon's electorate and avocacy groups, we focused on bringing forward a reform that maximizes choice in the single General Election when the most voters participate. <a href="srv#srv">Enter Score Runoff Voting</a>.

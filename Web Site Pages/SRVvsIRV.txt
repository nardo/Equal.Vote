<p><h3><strong>Traditional Instant Runoff or Version 2.0?</strong></h3>

<h4>SRV is new IRV hybrid</h4>

<div id="IRV"></div>
Traditional Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is the classic form of Ranked Choice — over more than a century, it's been used on and off in various places around the world. Score Runoff Voting (SRV) is a new hybrid version that combines score voting with an instant runoff to determine the final winner.

<h4>Metrics For Comparison</h4>

<p>Equal.Vote evaluates voting systems according to five primary criteria: <strong> honesty, equality, accuracy, simplicity, </strong>and<strong> expressiveness </strong>. The narrative below describes and then compares IRV and SRV according to these five metrics.</p>

<strong>The Rules and the Ballots</strong>
<br><br>
</div>

<h4>IRV uses rank-order ballot</h4>
<p>
IRV is one of many forms of Ranked Choice Voting that use a preference order ballot: first choice, second choice, third choice and so on. Because full rank ordering makes for a complex ballot (basically an N x N choice matrix for each office), IRV proponents typically advocate a limit of three or four choices on the ballot.
</p>

<h4>SRV uses a score ballot</h4>

<p>
SRV is a form of Ranked Choice that uses a score ballot: the voter can assign a level of support for each candidate, from zero to the maximum score.
</p>

<h4>Who gets to the final runoff?</h4>
<p>Both IRV and SRV have a final instant runoff round to determine the winner. What differentiates the two system is how they determine which candidates are present in the final runoff.
</p>

<h4>IRV uses multi-round elimination</h4>

<p>IRV determines the final contestants through a series of elimination rounds. In the first round, IRV counts only the top choice from each ballot. If no candidate has a majority, then the candidate with the fewest top votes gets eliminated. The ballots for that candidate are moved to their 2nd choice (if any is marked). In each successive round, the candidate with the fewest ballots in their column gets eliminated. Ballots from that column then move to their next choice among the candidates still remaining (if any). Once some candidate has a majority of the still-active ballots, they win the election.</p>

<h4>SRV uses runoff between two top scoring candidates</h4>

<p>In SRV, the final contestants are the two overall highest scoring candidates. The winner is the one with more ballots that show a preference for that candidate, based on those voters who gave a different score to each of the two.

<br>
<strong>Honesty:</strong> Can the voter safely express her honest opinion on the ballot, and likewise, to what level does the system disincentivize voters from strategically voting insincerely in order to produce a better outcome?
<br><br>
</div>

<h4>With IRV, voters can't always vote safely for honest favorite as 1st choice</h4>

<p>Instant Runoff Voting proponents <a href="http://www.betterballotbenton.com/the-benefits">often make the inaccurate claim</a> that with IRV, "you can honestly rank candidates in order of choice without having to worry about how others will vote and who is more or less likely to win." In fact, you can only safely rank candidates honestly in IRV if your favorite either has no chance at all or is a very strong candidate. Giving your top vote to your favorite in IRV can actually help elect your least favorite candidate. This video shows clearly how IRV suffers from a more general form of the vote-splitting spoiler effect:</p>

<h4>Plain score voting has potential strategic issues</h4>
<p>IRV advocates argue that <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/new_lessons_from_problems_with_approval_voting_in_practice">rating systems are vulnerable to tactical 'bullet voting'</a> — that is, support of just one candidate on the ballot in order to maximize the chance of one's favorite choice winning. Another strategic degrading that could happen with score is maximizing and minimizing the scores of all the candidates in order to play it safe. That means score voting would become simply approval voting.
</p>

<h4>Score Runoff synthesizes the best of IRV and score and minimizes problems</h4>

<p>Score Runoff Voting <strong>breaks the tactical tradeoff between these camps</strong>. The runoff phase <a href="strategic_srv">reduces the incentive to score second choices tactically</a>. The scoring phase ensures that the two strongest candidates overall advance to the final runoff, so you can honestly support your true favorite <strong>and</strong> second choice without worrying you'll be promoting a losing candidate over a stronger consensus choice <strong>or</strong> harming your favorite's chance of winning.

<div class="gray-box">
<br>
<strong>Equality:</strong> Does the voting system provide an equal weight vote to every voter?
<br><br>
</div>

<p>Score Runoff Voting passes the <strong><a href="theequalvote#test">test of balance</a></strong> that tells us definitively that a voting system provides an equal weight vote to all the voters: every possible vote expression in both the scoring and automatic runoff stages has an equal, balancing expression.

<p>Instant Runoff Voting doesn't pass the test: the way IRV is counted makes votes impossible to balance.

<p>IRV's counting algorithm only takes into account the second and subsequent choices of <em>some</em> of the voters: those whose first choice candidate(s) have been eliminated, so in IRV, second choice votes only <em>ever</em> count for those voters who happen to see their first choice eliminated <em>before</em> their second choice. If you pick a strong consensus candidate second, but your first choice hangs around in the count longer, your second choice is never factored in by the system. This has implications for honesty above and accuracy below.

<div class="gray-box">
<br>
<strong>Accuracy:</strong> How accurately does the voting system reflect the will of the people?
<br><br>
</div>

<p>Voting method simulation is used primarily to determine how accurately a voting method will produce an outcome that represents the will of the electorate. In a real human election it's hard to actually know what the voters really wanted - they could have been voting strategically, exit polling is imprecise and so on. By running simulated voters through thousands or millions of simulated elections, voting systems can be concretely evaluated and compared.

<p><img src="VSE_summary.png" alt="VSE_summary.png" /></p>

<p>Score Runoff Voting simulates best-in-class in the several election method simulators that have included it. Across the board, with both honest and mixes of strategic voters, SRV is <a href="equal_systems_science">"unquestionably a top-shelf method."</a>

<p>Traditional IRV, by contrast, doesn't come close to the top of the list. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258164743_Frequency_of_monotonicity_failure_under_Instant_Runoff_Voting_Estimates_based_on_a_spatial_model_of_elections">Recent work by Robert Norman</a>, a mathematician at Dartmouth, suggests that IRV's topsy-turvy math issues would create non-representative outcomes in one in five close contests among three candidates and that with larger numbers of candidates, it would happen even more often. The 2009 Mayoral IRV election in Burlington, Vermont was one such sideways election, and the results <strong>led to the repeal of IRV</strong> in Burlington the next year.

<br>
<strong>Simplicity:</strong> How easy is the system for voters to understand and cast ballots, and how easy is it for elections officials to tabulate and hand-recount?
<br><br>
</div>

<p>The mechanism for tabulating IRV can remain opaque even for sophisticated voters. Steve Pond <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/dont-believe-schmucks-24542/">wrote the following</a> about IRV after its adoption as the voting system for choosing Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy: "A year and a half after the Academy went to a different system for counting Best Picture ballots, <strong>nominees and voters and campaigners still don't understand how it works.</strong> And it's driving me crazy."

<p>Because IRV's counting algorithm goes through one round for each losing candidate until a winner is decided, elections can take many rounds to compute. The image below represents a sample election vote tally in the multi-round IRV process. It's hard for observers and lay voters to draw meaningful conclusions about voter preferences from these intermediate results:

<p><img src="IRV_results.png" alt="IRV_results.png" /></p>
<p>Score Runoff Voting is simple to tabulate. It is always completed in two rounds with transparent results that show overall popular support for every candidate. You can see the election results of the sample election run with SRV below:
<p><img src="SRV_results_vs_IRV.png" alt="SRV_results_vs_IRV.png" /></p>

<p>The winner of an IRV election cannot be tabulated until all ballot information is reported to a central location. Maine, which just passed IRV, is dealing with the <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/11/logistics-could-put-ranked-choice-voting-on-hold-in-2018/">headaches of this system now</a>, expecting that "ballots would have to be shipped by town clerks to a central location in Augusta for additional voting rounds. Thus the outcome of an election in a multiple-candidate race might not be known for several weeks."

<p>Oregon would likely use the internet to transfer election data from the counties to the state HQ, so we expect it wouldn't take weeks, but regardless, the lack of <strong>precinct summability</strong> is a real weakness of IRV. Each locale has to come up with all of the many possible combinations of rank orderings and report the total for each, in order that the central counting authority can begin the process to determine the winner. These partial results give little meaningful information to the voters. A small subset of one election's partial results in IRV might look like this:</p>

<p><img src="IRV_precinct.png" alt="IRV_precinct.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Score Runoff Voting results can be summed by precinct</strong>, both the overall score as well as the preference totals for each candidate pair. This gives information that is useful in understanding how the local electorate felt about the election and makes the results easier to verify by hand-recount:

<div class="gray-box">
<br>
<strong>Expressiveness:</strong> Can the voter express a nuanced opinion on the outcome?
<br><br>
</div>

<p>Our current voting system, where we are limited to picking a single favorite in each election, is the least expressive voting system humans have ever constructed. Instant Runoff Voting allows the voter to express an opinion on multiple candidates by placing them in preference order. Still, preference order alone leaves out a ton of information. For example, the same ordering <strong>A > B > C</strong> could mean that the voter thinks A is an awesome candidate, B is mediocre and C is the devil incarnate or that A is awesome, B is almost as awesome, and C is just a hair less awesome than A and B. Furthermore while IRV lets you express support for more than one candidate, it doesn't actually count that secondary support at all until your first choice candidate is eliminated.

<p>Score Runoff Voting has a <strong>more expressive ballot</strong>. Instead of only counting the voter's support for one candidate at a time, SRV allows the voter to express, and counts, a nuanced level of support for any number of candidates on the ballot.

<p><strong>It's Time For 2.0</strong>

<p>The need for true election reform is more apparent now than ever before, and the recent adoption of IRV in Benton County, OR and the state of Maine show that electorates on both coasts are ready for more expressive voting systems. What we need now is the upgraded version, that actually gets rid of the spoiler effect once and for all and isn't <a href="https://electology.org/irv-repealed">vulnerable to repeal after adoption</a> due to complexity of implementation and non-representative outcomes.

<p>The American electorate is hungry for a real solution to our broken political system. We clearly need an election system that gives us all an equal say, accurately reflects our collective will in the outcome, is simple for us to ballot and for elections officials to tabulate, and that allows us to expressively share our honest opinions on the outcome. By all these measures, the new IRV - Score Runoff Voting - is the clear winner. 

<p>Oregon has <a href="reform">long history</a> of pioneering new, innovative reform proposals. The time is now to take up the mantle once again and <a href="srv#srv">blaze a new trail</a> to a better voting franchise.
